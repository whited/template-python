# Python Bootstrap (Basic)

This repository is intended to be a Template for bootstrapping generic Python projects.
I wrote this to make getting started a bit quicker for myself.  Anyone is welcome to use it, but it comes with NO support..

To Setup initial python virtual env, do the following:
```bash
# create virtual environment
python -m venv .venv

# activate env
source .venv/bin/activate

# Update PIP, and install requirements
pip install --upgrade pip
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

Then start working in either:
- [src/main.py]
- [notebooks/notebook.ipynb]
